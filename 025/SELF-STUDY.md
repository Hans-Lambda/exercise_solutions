# Storing Data as JSON

JSON is the most common format for serializing structured data. A Serialization process converts a data structure to a
different one, usually a standard recognized by other programming languages and systems. The serialization process
using standard formats facilitates the exchange of information. The process of receiving serialized data and converting
it to a language/system-specific structure is called deserialization.

Your task is to research the process of serialization/deserialization in Python using JSON as the serialization format.
In Python, dictionaries have a connection to JSON. The JSON structure is very similar to Python dictionaries, but not
the same. The module `json` in python provides us with functions to manipulate JSON strings and files. You must
focus on:

- The `json` module
- How to save/load a dictionary to a file using the JSON format.
- Create a simple example application so that you can showcase the process
of saving and loading data from a file using the JSON format.
- Catalog all the material you find helpful so we can share it at the end with all the colleagues.
