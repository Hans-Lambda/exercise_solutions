_3 May. Bistritz._--Left Munich at 8:35 P. M., on 1st May, arriving at
late and would start as near the correct time as possible. The
Vienna early next morning; should have arrived at 6:46, but train was an
impression I had was that we were leaving the West and entering the
hour late. Buda-Pesth seems a wonderful place, from the glimpse which I
East; the most western of splendid bridges over the Danube, which is
got of it from the train and the little I could walk through the
here of noble width and depth, took us among the traditions of Turkish
streets. I feared to go very far from the station, as we had arrived
rule.
