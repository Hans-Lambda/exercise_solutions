# Task 1

## Research about Agile Methodologies and answer the questions bellow by writing an article about the topic. Work in pairs (article with max. 2 pages in english or german). Try to answer the following questions:

* Why Agile and Why is it so popular in Software Development Project Management?
* What are the main benefits of applying Agile Methodologies?
* How many Agile methodologies exists out there?
* What is Scrum? Read the scrum manifesto.
* Are Agile Methodologies the best option for any project?

## General Information

* Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
* Working software over comprehensive documentation
* Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
* Responding to change over following a plan

## “How might we perform project management in a way that allows us to create and respond to change and deal with uncertainty?”

## 12 Principles behind the Agile Manifesto

* We follow these principles: Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.
* Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer's competitive advantage.
* Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale.
* Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project.
* Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done.
* The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation.
* Working software is the primary measure of progress.
* Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.
* Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.
* Simplicity--the art of maximizing the amount of work not done--is essential.
* The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.
* At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly.

## Agile 101

* pair programming, test-driven development, stand-ups, planning sessions, and sprints.
* focus on the people doing the work and how they work together. 
* Solutions evolve through collaboration between self-organizing cross-functional teams utilizing the appropriate practices for their context.

## Key Concepts

* User Stories: In consultation with the customer or product owner, the team divides up the work to be done into functional increments called “user stories.” Each user story is expected to yield a contribution to the value of the overall product.
* Daily Meeting: Each day at the same time, the team meets so as to bring everyone up to date on the information that is vital for coordination: each team members briefly describes any “completed” contributions and any obstacles that stand in their way.
* Personas: When the project calls for it – for instance when user experience is a major factor in project outcomes – the team crafts detailed, synthetic biographies of fictitious users of the future product: these are called “personas.”
* Team: A “team” in the Agile sense is a small group of people, assigned to the same project or effort, nearly all of them on a full-time basis. A small minority of team members may be part-time contributors, or may have competing responsibilities.
* Incremental Development: Nearly all Agile teams favor an incremental development strategy; in an Agile context, this means that each successive version of the product is usable, and each builds upon the previous version by adding user-visible functionality.
* Iterative Development: Agile projects are iterative insofar as they intentionally allow for “repeating” software development activities, and for potentially “revisiting” the same work products.
* Milestone Retrospective: Once a project has been underway for some time, or at the end of the project, all of the team’s permanent members (not just the developers) invests from one to three days in a detailed analysis of the project’s significant events.

## Methodologies

* Scrum
* XP (Extreme Programming)
* FDD (Feature-Driven-Environment)

### Scrum

* Courage, Focus, Commitment, Respect, and Openness.
* Transparency, Inspection, Adaption.
* In a nutshell, Scrum requires a Scrum Master to foster an environment where:
  1. A Product Owner orders the work for a complex problem into a Product Backlog. 
  2. The Scrum Team turns a selection of the work into an Increment of value during a Sprint. 
  3. The Scrum Team and its stakeholders inspect the results and adjust for the next Sprint. 
  4. Repeat
* All the work necessary to achieve the Product Goal, including Sprint Planning, Daily Scrums, Sprint Review, and Sprint Retrospective, happen within Sprints.
  1. During the Sprint:
  2. No changes are made that would endanger the Sprint Goal;
  3. Quality does not decrease;
  4. The Product Backlog is refined as needed; and,
  5. Scope may be clarified and renegotiated with the Product Owner as more is learned.

### Traditional Development

* Projects are run in a sequential cycle: initiation, planning, execution, monitoring, and closure.
* Emphasizes linear processes, documentation, upfront planning, and prioritization.
* Time and budget are variable, and requirements are fixed, due to which it often faces budget and timeline issues.
* Benefits of traditional methodology
  1. Clearly defined objectives
  2. Ultimate control
  3. Clear documentation
  4. More accountability

### Agile Project Management

* The agile manifesto has four essential values:
  1. More focus on individuals and interactions than processes and tools
  2. Working software is more important than comprehensive documentation
  3. Customer collaboration is more vital than negotiation
  4. The process should respond to change rather than blindly following a plan
* Benefits of Agile project management
  1. Flexible prioritization
  2. Early and predictable delivery
  3. Predictable costs and schedules
  4. Improves quality
  5. More transparency
* Agile follows an iterative process where projects are divided into sprints of a shorter span. Unlike the traditional approach, less time is spent on upfront planning and prioritization as agile is more flexible in changes and specifications developments.
