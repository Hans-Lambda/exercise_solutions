### Posible Challenges

1. **Are the Students already using linux?** If the students are not using 
Linux, this will bring some challenges because they will need to learn how
to do that, and the process can be challenging for some of them. Without the
Linux/Ubuntu operational system installed, the students will not be able to
do the exercises of the upcoming classes.
