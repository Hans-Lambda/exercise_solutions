1. Write a program that declares two lists, e.g.
    ```python
    l1 = [2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 10]
    l2 = [9, 4, 3, 9, 3, 1]
    ```
    and creates a new list containing the sum 
    from elements, of both lists, with the same index. 
    The result of the sum of the lists above are:

    ```python
    [11, 7, 7, 14, 11, 11]
    ```
   
2. Create a program that declares a list, then asks the user to type 
   an integer value, remove from the list all occurrences of this value.
   Let's say you declare the following list in your program:
   ```python
   l = [2, 3, 3, 4, 3, 2, 1, 3]
   ```
   If the user types 3, the resulting list will be:
   ```python
   [2, 4, 2, 1]
   ```
