# OOP Design Patterns

When we architect a system and analyze its requirements and features, we have to think about how to organize the classes
and the relationship between them. After working on different projects, we start to identify some patterns that appear
in various projects.

Some patterns used to occur so often that they were cataloged and classified. The book **Design Patterns. Elements of
Reusable Object-Oriented Software, Erich Gama et al.** was one of the first attempts to catalog these patterns and
provide recipes to those trying to apply them.

Patterns are then divided into three categories, creational, behavioral, and structural. Polymorphism and Abstract
Classes (and Interfaces, a concept not present in Python) are essential tools for implementing these patterns.

Your task is to research at least two of the following patterns:

- Factory Pattern
- Singleton
- Observer
- Strategy
- Adapter

In the end, you must have a Google Presentation containing the following information:

- What is the objective of the pattern?
- What is the classification (creational, behavioral, or structural) of the pattern.
- Provide a working code in Python of an example.
- If the pattern requires polymorphism or abstract classes
  explain why you need these concepts.
- You have to present your slides to the class.

> This activity is to be done in groups of three.
